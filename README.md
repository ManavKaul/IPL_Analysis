This is a mini project by me using data from Kaggle 

I am new to the field of data science and I am putting this as a milestone for my first project

Aim of the project is to understand the impact of toss on the outcome of the game 

To achieve the same I first analysed the number of wins of each team to get an Idea of how each team performs

I then analysed on the outcome of games for the teams which won the toss

Following which I analysed the pattern of choices of each team

From the analysis of above information I could derive a clear distinction between the teams who have higher wins and their toss choices and others

I derived a conclusion from the above distinction and gave my hypothesis on the reasons behind same
